# MyReactApplication
A Sample application that involves concepts of React - #Self Learning

To start with I have created a small application that display weather forecast on the location searched.
I have used openweathermap api to get the weather information on the location searched.

I have used inbuild fetch servie to do this api call.
Later I will try to use axios for all my http calls.
